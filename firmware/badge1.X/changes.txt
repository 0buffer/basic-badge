0.10
- you can now enter new lines into the source buffer, though for now only appending at the end of program, you can't insert it in the middle - that is high in TODO list
- help command - writes out help
- clr command - clears program buffer, so you can write new program
- first numbered revision, 0.10 now. A lot of revision numbers available up to 1.00

0.11
-  allow inserting new lines of code anywhere, as well as overwriting previously entered lines.

0.12
- moved to github

0.13
- a lot of new things
- Z80 interpreter from Udo Munk added, along with CP/M binaries and my CP/M BIOS tailored for virtual machines like this one. I can now run CP/M on the badge. There is 50kB RAM disk and 128kB ROM disk, containing useful stuff like ED, DDT, XMODEM, UNARC or MBASIC. I can send new binaries to CP/M machine via serial port and XMODEM protocol. Optionally, those can be ARC-ed on PC and un-ARC-ed on CP/M machine. Lots of possibilities to come with this one. FLASH disks don't work by now, probably in next version.
- BASIC interpreter got some more tweaks and it's now better separated from other tasks. Major cleanup/separation of sources is needed, though.
- primitive menu on start, allowing to choose either BASIC interpreter or CP/M machine.

0.14
- half of FLASH memory now appears as four disk drives by 512k each in CP/M system. I downloaded ZORK via XMODEM and spent a while playing it.

0.15
- local display terminal is now accepting VT100 escape sequences. Turbo Pascal or Wordstar under CP/M should now run with sensible output on display, should be better for everything else, too. 
- fixed bug where first command after starting BASIC interpreter was be mangled, resulting in funny behavior

- music generator, available from BASIC interpreter
